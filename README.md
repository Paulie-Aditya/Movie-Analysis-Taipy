You would be able to find out the Sentiment of Any Movie available on IMDb!


Here, BeautifulSoup has been used for Scraping the data from IMDb to fetch authentic user reviews. A Sentiment Analyzer is then used on these reviews to find out what the overall sentiment of the movie is.

This Sentiment and the Confidence is then sent to the frontend and using Taipy, the final output is shown back to the user.
